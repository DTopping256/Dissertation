# Complete so far

- 2nd revision of lit review (more to add as research is ongoing)
- Research on data augmentation.

# Feb

## Practical

1. [x] Complete raw drum data collection.
2. [x] Complete data augmentation techniques and preparation for the NN.
3. [x] Convert as much raw data as is needed into augmented data.
4. [x] Seperate this data into training and testing data.
5. [x] Design a NN with justification for each layers usage from research.
6. [ ] Test as proof of concept with some data

## Research

7. [x] In depth research on NN layers and structures:

- [x] Pooling layers (max/min/avg (local & global)).
- [x] Dropout layers
- [ ] Multiclass output layer (a better name exists, needs research)

## Writing

8. [ ] Update lit review
9. [ ] Start methodology
10. [ ] Start abstract
