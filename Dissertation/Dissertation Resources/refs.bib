abstract = {Because of the “all-or-none” character of nervous activity, neural events and the relations among them can be treated by means of propositional logic. It is found that the behavior of every net can be described in these terms, with the addition of more complicated logical means for nets containing circles; and that for any logical expression satisfying certain conditions, one can find a net behaving in the fashion it describes. It is shown that many particular choices among possible neurophysiological assumptions are equivalent, in the sense that for every net behaving under one assumption, there exists another net which behaves under the other and gives the same results, although perhaps not in the same time. Various applications of the calculus are discussed.},

abstract = {Deeper neural networks are more difficult to train. We present a residual learning framework to ease the training of networks that are substantially deeper than those used previously. We explicitly reformulate the layers as learning residual functions with reference to the layer inputs, instead of learning unreferenced functions. We provide comprehensive empirical evidence showing that these residual networks are easier to optimize, and can gain accuracy from considerably increased depth. On the ImageNet dataset we evaluate residual nets with a depth of up to 152 layers---8x deeper than VGG nets but still having lower complexity. An ensemble of these residual nets achieves 3.57{\%} error on the ImageNet test set. This result won the 1st place on the ILSVRC 2015 classification task. We also present analysis on CIFAR-10 with 100 and 1000 layers. The depth of representations is of central importance for many visual recognition tasks. Solely due to our extremely deep representations, we obtain a 28{\%} relative improvement on the COCO object detection dataset. Deep residual nets are foundations of our submissions to ILSVRC {\&} COCO 2015 competitions, where we also won the 1st places on the tasks of ImageNet detection, ImageNet localization, COCO detection, and COCO segmentation.},

abstract = {This paper describes a novel method for the automatic transcrip- tion of drum sequences. The method is based on separating the target drum sounds from the input signal using non-negative ma- trix factorisation, and on detecting sound onsets from the separated signals. The separation algorithm factorises the spectrogram of the input signal into a sum of instrument spectrograms, each having a fixed spectrum and a time-varying gain. The spectra are cal- culated from a set of training signals, and the time-varying gains are estimated with an algorithm stemming from non-negative ma- trix factorisation. Onset times of the instruments are detected from the estimated time-varying gains. The system gave better results than two state-of-the-art methods in simulations with acoustic sig- nals containing polyphonic drum sequences, and overall hit rate of 96{\%} was accomplished.

Receptive fields, defined as restricted areas where illumination influenced the firing of a single cortical unit, usually contained mutually antagonistic excitatory and inhibitory regions. Thus a stimulus covering a whole field was relatively ineffective in driving most units. Effective driving of a unit required a stimulus specific in form, size, position, and orientation; based on the arrangement of excitatory and inhibitory areas. About 20{\%} of the cortical units studied could be activated from either eye; these were driven from roughly homologous regions of the retinas and summation and antagonism could be shown.

@techreport{Paulus2010,
abstract = {This thesis proposes signal processing methods for the analysis of musical audio on two time scales: drum transcription on a finer time scale and music structure analysis on the time scale of entire pieces. The former refers to the process of locating drum sounds in the input and recognising the instruments that were used to produce the sounds. The latter refers to the temporal segmentation of a musical piece into parts, such as chorus and verse. For drum transcription, both low-level acoustic recognition and high-level musicological modelling methods are presented. A baseline acoustic recognition method with a large number of features using Gaussian mixture models for the recognition of drum combinations is presented. Since drums occur in structured patterns, modelling of the sequential dependencies with N-grams is proposed. In addition to the conventional N-grams, periodic N-grams are proposed to model the dependencies between events that occur one pattern length apart. The evaluations show that incorporating musicological modelling improves the performance considerably. As some drums are more probable to occur at certain points in a pattern, this dependency is utilised for producing transcriptions of signals produced with arbitrary sounds, such as beatboxing. A supervised source separation method using non-negative matrix factorisation is proposed for transcribing mixtures of drum sounds. Despite the simple signal model, a high performance is obtained for signals without other instruments. Most of the drum transcription methods operate only on single-channel inputs, but multichannel signals are available in recording studios. A multichannel extension of the source separation method is proposed, and an increase in performance is observed in evaluations. Many of the drum transcription methods rely on detecting sound onsets for the segmentation of the signal. Detection errors will then decrease the overall performance of the system. To overcome this problem, a method utilising a network of connected hidden Markov models is proposed to perform the event segmentation and recognition jointly. The system is shown to be able to perform the transcription even from polyphonic music. The second main topic of this thesis is music structure analysis. Two methods are proposed for this purpose. The first relies on defining a cost function for a description of the repeated parts. The second method defines a fitness function for descriptions covering the entire piece. The abstract cost (and fitness) functions are formulated in terms that can be determined from the input signal algorithmically, and optimisation problems are formulated. In both cases, an algorithm is proposed for solving the optimisation problems. The first method is evaluated on a small data set, and the relevance of the cost function terms is shown. The latter method is evaluated on three large data sets with a total of 831 (557+174+100) songs. This is to date the largest evaluation of a structure analysis method. The evaluations show that the proposed method outperforms a reference system on two of the data sets. Music structure analysis methods rarely provide musically meaningful names for the parts in the result. A method is proposed to label the parts in descriptions based on a statistical model of the sequential dependencies between musical parts. The method is shown to label the main parts relatively reliably without any additional information. The labelling model is further integrated into the fitness function based structure analysis method.},

We re-evaluate the state of the art for object recognition from small images with convolutional networks, questioning the necessity of different components in the pipeline. We find that max-pooling can simply be replaced by a convolutional layer with increased stride without loss in accuracy on several image recognition benchmarks. Following this finding -- and building on other recent work for finding simple network structures -- we propose a new architecture that consists solely of convolutional layers and yields competitive or state of the art performance on several object recognition datasets (CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, ImageNet). To analyze the network we introduce a new variant of the "deconvolution approach" for visualizing features learned by CNNs, which can be applied to a broader range of network structures than existing approaches.},

A single WaveNet can capture the characteristics of many different speakers with equal fidelity, and can switch between them by conditioning on the speaker identity.

Orofacial injury occurring as a direct result of a seizure was determined by clinical examination and interview. In addition, seizure frequency, use of medication, and the occurrence and type of injury to other parts of the body, were documented. We employed regression analyses to investigate the association between teeth fractures and frequency of seizures. The majority of injuries were crown fractures (42 subjects), followed by mandibular fractures (eight subjects) and tooth avulsion (eight subjects). Sixteen patients had more than two fractured teeth. Patients with mandibular trauma also suffered concomitant injuries (teeth fracture, avulsion and dislocation). The number of fractured teeth was associated with seizure frequency (r(2) = 0.59, p {\textless} 0.001). The data suggest that there is an increased rate of dentoalveolar and maxillofacial injuries in patients with poorly controlled epileptic seizures.},

abstract = {Training Deep Neural Networks is complicated by the fact that the distribution of each layer's inputs changes during training, as the parameters of the previous layers change. This slows down the training by requiring lower learning rates and careful parameter initialization, and makes it no- toriously hard to train models with saturating nonlineari- ties. We refer to this phenomenon as internal covariate shift, and address the problem by normalizing layer in- puts. Our method draws its strength frommaking normal- ization a part ofthe model architecture and performing the normalization for each training mini-batch. Batch Nor- malization allows us to use much higher learning rates and be less careful about initialization. It also acts as a regu- larizer, in some cases eliminating the need for Dropout. Applied to a state-of-the-art image classification model, Batch Normalization achieves the same accuracy with 14 times fewer training steps, and beats the original model by a significant margin. Using an ensemble of batch- normalized networks, we improve upon the best published result on ImageNet classification: reaching 4.9{\%} top-5 validation error (and 4.8{\%} test error), exceeding the ac- curacy of human raters. 1},

@report{gmsw2016,
abstract = {In this paper we investigate the benefit of augmenting data with synthetically created samples when training a machine learning classifier. Two approaches for creating additional training samples are data warping, which generates additional samples through transformations applied in the data-space, and synthetic over-sampling, which creates additional samples in feature-space. We experimentally evaluate the benefits of data augmentation for a convolutional backpropagation-trained neural network, a convolutional support vector machine and a convolutional extreme learning machine classifier, using the standard MNIST handwritten digit dataset. We found that while it is possible to perform generic augmentation in feature-space, if plausible transforms for the data are known then augmentation in data-space provides a greater benefit for improving performance and reducing overfitting.},

@techreport{Lecun1998,
abstract = {Multilayer neural networks trained with the back-propagation algorithm constitute the best example of a successful gradient-based learning technique. Given an appropriate network architecture, gradient-based learning algorithms can be used to synthesize a complex decision surface that can classify high-dimensional patterns, such as handwritten characters, with minimal preprocessing. This paper reviews various methods applied to handwritten character recognition and compares them on a standard handwritten digit recognition task. Convolutional neural networks, which are specifically designed to deal with the variability of two dimensional (2-D) shapes, are shown to outperform all other techniques. Real-life document recognition systems are composed of multiple modules including field extraction, segmentation, recognition, and language modeling. A new learning paradigm, called graph transformer networks (GTN's), allows such multimodule systems to be trained globally using gradient-based methods so as to minimize an overall performance measure. Two systems for online handwriting recognition are described. Experiments demonstrate the advantage of global training, and the flexibility of graph transformer networks. A graph transformer network for reading a bank check is also described. It uses convolutional neural network character recognizers combined with global training techniques to provide record accuracy on business and personal checks. It is deployed commercially and reads several million checks per day.},

abstract = {Automatic music transcription is considered by many to be a key enabling technology in music signal processing. However, the performance of transcription systems is still significantly below that of a human expert, and accuracies reported in recent years seem to have reached a limit, although the field is still very active. In this paper we analyse limitations of current methods and identify promising directions for future research. Current transcription methods use general purpose models which are unable to capture the rich diversity found in music signals. One way to overcome the limited performance of transcription systems is to tailor algorithms to specific use-cases. Semi-automatic approaches are another way of achieving a more reliable transcription. Also, the wealth of musical scores and corresponding audio data now available are a rich potential source of training data, via forced alignment of audio to scores, but large scale utilisation of such data has yet to be attempted. Other promising approaches include the integration of information from multiple algorithms and different musical aspects.},

abstract = {We propose a deep convolutional neural network architecture codenamed "Inception", which was responsible for setting the new state of the art for classification and detection in the ImageNet Large-Scale Visual Recognition Challenge 2014 (ILSVRC 2014). The main hallmark of this architecture is the improved utilization of the computing resources inside the network. This was achieved by a carefully crafted design that allows for increasing the depth and width of the network while keeping the computational budget constant. To optimize quality, the architectural decisions were based on the Hebbian principle and the intuition of multi-scale processing. One particular incarnation used in our submission for ILSVRC 2014 is called GoogLeNet, a 22 layers deep network, the quality of which is assessed in the context of classification and detection.},
