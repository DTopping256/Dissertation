# Dissertation

This repo contains the source-code for my undergraduate dissertation project, where neural network models for drum kit timbre recognition were tested.

It's mainly comprised of various Jupyter Notebook files, one per configuration of each model, but also includes the saved model structures and trained weights as well as utility modules and processing scripts written in python to create and manage the dataset.
